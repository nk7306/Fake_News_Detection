# Fake News Detection Project

## Overview
This project is dedicated to building a machine learning model to accurately detect fake news, leveraging natural language processing techniques. The dataset consists of 40,000 articles divided into two files: `true.csv` (true articles) and `false.csv` (fake articles), each containing 20,000 entries.

## Dataset Description
Our dataset includes:
- **true.csv**: Contains verified true news articles.
- **false.csv**: Contains verified false news articles.

Each file features data such as article title, text content, and publication date.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For model building and text data processing.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For advanced neural network architectures.

## Model Implementation
Key steps in our project include:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing data for model training.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Utilizing techniques such as TF-IDF for feature extraction.
3. **Model Training**: Implementing various models from simple logistic regression to complex neural networks.
4. **Evaluation**: Analyzing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results and Analysis
We provide a thorough analysis of the models' performances, accompanied by confusion matrices and other visualization tools to understand strengths and weaknesses.

## Conclusion
This project contributes to the important task of detecting fake news, with potential applications in various sectors that rely on the dissemination of factual information.
